i: INSTALLATION
-In order to clone or download website for functionality on local drives, be sure to install files to proper locations.

-index.html, portfolio.html,documentsAndLinks.html, contact.html. and resume.pdf should be located in the source folder. The source folder should also contain an "assets" folder.

-Inside of the "assets" folder, make sure there is an "images" folder. The CSS folder is unecessary at this time.

-Clone or download images available to the "images" folder and the css files to the "css" folder.

ii: USAGE
-Layout is as it appears, functions, and is responsive. The index page contains my About Me, the portfolio page contains links to past work, the documents and links page contains my resume and professional links, and the contact page gives users a form to contact me by email. More will be added in coming updates.
