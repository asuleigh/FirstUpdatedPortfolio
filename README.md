i: INSTALLATION
-In order to clone or download website for functionality on local drives, be sure to install files to proper locations.

-index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html should be located in the source folder. The source folder should also contain an "assets" folder.

-Inside of the "assets" folder, make sure there is an "images" folder. The CSS folder is unecessary at this time.

-Clone or download images available to the "images" folder

ii: USAGE
-Layout is as it appears. The index page contains my About Me, the portfolio page contains links to past work, and the contact page gives users a form to contact me. Links in Header work and so does the Submit button. Currently messages will not redirect, though you can interact with the box. More will be added/finished in coming updates.
